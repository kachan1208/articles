Title: Another job search.
 
Have you ever felt anxiety, tension, nervousness, internal emptiness, uselessness and many other negative emotions that/which show you your inability to find a proper place for your skills?
 
If not, I have some bad news for you, are you a human being?!
If not, I have a question to ask you, “Are you even a human being?!”
 
But at least once per your arising or even already grown career path you have felt that terrible feelings.
But at least once on the path of your arising or even already grown career you have felt these/those terrible feelings.
/
I’m pretty certain that at least once on the path of your arising or even already grown career you have felt these/those terrible feelings.
 
Just be honest with yourself, you had a lot of declines/rejections because company found someone who’s more experienced than you;
or your skills don't match with the company's view about the ideal candidate and you were declined/rejected even without any interview;
or you feel that you can't meet at least half of the requirements of the proposal;
or an HR forgot to give you a feedback after a few steps of interviewing process;
or… well, I guess, you’ve got the point. // should I even go on?
 
How many or’s can you write?
How many or’s have you ever had?
How many stupid reject reasons have you heard about your profile and why you were rejected to that "ideal position"(to your mind)?
/
How many absurd excuses have you heard for not being given the position, which is perfect for you, in your opinion?
 
In each job seeking process, there is a place for shit, which happens to everyone.
/
Shit like this happens to everyone in any job seeking process even if you are a superstar.
 
I also had those terrible feelings, with most of them being present simultaneously.
Mostly Basically, I want to tell you about a lot of things that might be useful in any aspect of your life because they might change you, your understanding of communication with others and especially your self-esteem.
And here is something I found inside myself, which can help you in your future way of finding a perfect position.
 
Have you ever felt left behind by other, more flashy, more assertive people who get what they want while you’re just hanging there, helpless, cherishing what you have? I have reflected a lot of times on my internal disappointment from having no possibility to get the dream job even if I have had really high positions in previous companies. It wasn’t until the moment when I left my last job and found myself in the middle of a crucifying torture of numerous job interviews that I realized what one of my problems was. Modesty. ... 
Don’t be modest at work, in life, in communication with others, in your relationship. You should understand one simple fact - you are either modest or successful.
-----
I’m not saying don't say that you should be arrogant instead. Being non-modest is not about telling people how cool I am, or saying that I’m an amazing specialist and the best in my area when I’m actually not. It’s also better not to tell people about my vibrant life even if it is, or about things I bought last weekend. It’s not a good idea to be a me-person, either, that is, talking only about myself. No!
 
It's wrong way of understanding of "don't be modest". It should mean - tell about your achievements and real ambitions when you asked.
I’d like to make it clear that by ‘not being modest’ I mean that you should tell about your achievements and real ambitions or concerns when you are asked. For example posts you’ve written, great ideas you’ve shared, speeches you’ve made, projects you’ve finished, ideas you’re working on, "local world"(in your area) problems you’ve solved, fields you’re interested in and many more. The key point is not to Don't pay a lot of too much attention to yourself. Rather try to make an emphasis on the topic you’re talking about, make it more detailed, understandable and enjoyable for another person. So, in general, we should change the way we communicate with others and change our the approach to expressing ourselves.
 
 
But why? Why we should change our approach in communication? Nowadays mostly everything was created by group of people, not by individual. All great projects or products were created by group of people and not by one person, they communicated, shared their ideas, helped each other to achieve their best or to solve their problems. Communication is the biggest part of everybodies lives. Everyday, everyone communicate with each other in different ways. Because it's the only one skill that can help you to express yourslef, and show you from another side which. But let's try to figure it out on example. What is one of the biggest today's industries? Marketing! Companies spends their billions budgets only with one thought in the mind - to sell you a product. They seek for the best slogans that will take your minds, for the best collor combinations on their billboards that will hunt for your attention, for the most сreative ideas that will express the whole product almost instantly. Companies are looking for the way to communicate with you. Advertisment is way to communicate with the clients. Just one ad, that spreads like a virus can change the whole history of the companie's life. It can bring an extremely huge success and tremendous fail or even kill the company and bury it in the history. So, the biggest business makers, are really good in advertisment.
 
Why we can't take this simple idea of marketing - express yourself? Why we can't sell ourselves like a product that will fit all future requirements of the client, which is a company in our case? But it sounds like we want to manipulate others by communication, by "good advertisment"? No, it's not about that. Communication will help you just to tell about yourself. To tell the correct things and even words to express your experience. You should grown inside yourself an abbility to sell your skills and experience, to tell about yourself. Even with the correct idea that expressed with wrong words you can destroy your whole speech, burn communication bridges and distract another person. You should improve the way you talk, express, discuss, argue, praise. Because even the best specialist, really the cool guy like Elon Musk but without skill to speak, who can't tell about his work will not get the good position, nobody will know about his abilities and how good he is.
 
Also, just develop your day to day communication skill and become a nice person to talk with. You can become a farmer or a truck driver and almost don't talk to others... But we are realists... All your further dream companies will consist of more that one person, and with you have to communicate with your colleagues, It's might be better to say "YOU MUST COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS". Most of the valuable project's can't be done just only by one person or they can take a tremendous amount of time or even all your life and don't be finished. And pay a lot of attention on how you were heard and understood by others. How can you ask for help if you even can't construct a proper question.
 
Now we understand that we should express yourself, but we don't understand how to show our best sides. So how can we do that? We need to investigate our whole experience, our knowledge and put the line under the points of our life where we were the most productive, did the coollest things in perspective of work. Choose one day during next three monthes and just ask yourself several questions:
 
- What have I done?
- What was the most valuable thing to do?
- What I have achieved?
- What I haven't achieved?
- What I want to achieve during next three monthes?
 
Constan't investigation process will show you, how many things you've done, how many things you've learned, how many things you've planned to do and how many of them you've finished. Put the line under the most valuable and interesting of them and remember - you are not impostor, you are a specialist. Be proud of yourself even if there are a lot of things you haven't done and don't be nervous.
Realise one simple thing if you are constantly working in any topic and tries to grow as a specialist as a person - you will have something to say about during your next interview.
 
Be sure in the things that you've done or worked with. ...
 
Don't be scared of interviews and try not to be nervous before or on them. Make a short experiment. Schedule two different interviews in two different companies where one company is the company you are interested in and another one is something where you don't want to work. In first case you will be nervous, will not know what to expect. You would be possibly scared of questions that would be possibly asked you during interviewing process, and your internal tension and nervousness will drain all your mental energy. On interview you will be possibly devastated and would not be able to answer even simple questions or tell about yourself and make an emphasis on correct points of your work experience(if you have one). Nervousness bring you some uncertainty onto your answers.
Second interview, would be the easiest one, you will not feel distraction, anxiety, tension, you would be sure in most of your answers and would tell about yourself without any problems.
 
I had that two kind of interviews a lot of times. On the interview into one of my "dream" companies I was very nervous and even asked a strange question: "Why did you reply and schedule an interview with me?". I was not sure if I'm good enough and my skills would fit a companie's perspective. From the beginning stress started to eat my mind and drain my physical energy. Interviwer got my feelings, found me too stressed and said a funny joke which helped me to relax a bit. I found in my speech a lof of mistakes in simplest questions, I talked like a "Flash" without giving interviewer a possibility to realise what I'm talking about and why I'm talking about this. I was declined, even after the first screening interview where we just discussed topics related to everything around and not to my experience.
 
Then a while ago I had an interview in the company I wasn't interested. The situation with job search started to be very stressfull and frightening. No money, reduced amount of english classes, had a thought to stop taking them, even no possibility to invite my spouse somewhere. The criticality of situation goes over my psychological borders. I didn't have any internal wish to work in that "default" outsorcing company but wanted to get at least any job offer to return confidence. I hadn't prepared cause of my internal emptiness but it was the easiest job interview I had in my life. I felt like nothing exceptional happening with me right now we had a relly nice discussion like with friends. Without any problems I anwered to all questions, and we finished interview with positive set. Unfortunatelly I didn't get the offer, they found someone more experienced as HR said but, I don't think so, they just found a "cheaper" guy to work on "default" shitty tasks who will not ask additional questions about the project, profit, marketing, etc.
 
This different interviews sounds like "interesting and very stressfull, extremely hard interview where you should waste all your today's energy" and "not interesting but super easy" helped me to understand really useful tip: "don't be nervous and trust yourself". You should trust yourself and don't be scared to talk to others, even if this "others" ask you questions. Start thinking and learn how to improvise. Nothing exceptional will happen in basic job interview if you will not have a plan of that interview, you will just check yourself in non standard situation where you can find how your brain is working. Don't think about stupid situations, don't imagine: "what can happen if..." it's not necessary.
 
During your job search procedure you can receive a lot of different declines with a lot of funny reasons, the first one is: "Sorry but we found a person who fit more requirement's than you". Mostly companies doesn't tell you a reall reason of decline and it can really differ from what they told you. I was declined a lot of times, and 90% of declines looked like the same template message, even after 2 monthes of the very last step of companies application. Sometimes HR managers can forget to give you a feedback, if so just ask them about it, don't be scared to ask, it' shouldn't cost you more than stand up from the chair.
 
At the moment of last my job search I already had 5 years of experience, but I found a really valuable job position in international company with really cool guys only after 15 declines during 3 weeks, I almost gave up. Don't pay attention to most of declines, try to analyse what really stands behind decline, you are really bad at something and don't have a proper experience or you just bad at "selling yourself".
 
Be confident in yourself, in your skills, in the rate you request, in the job you are looking for, be stable and ambitios take from life what you want to take and get the job you always have dreamed and don't forget to Reflect all the time you live your life!
