I’m pretty certain that at least once on the path of your arising or even already grown career you have felt these/those terrible feelings.
 
Just be honest with yourself, you had a lot of declines/rejections because company found someone who’s more experienced than you;
or your skills don't match with the company's view about the ideal candidate and you were declined/rejected even without any interview;
or you feel that you can't meet at least half of the requirements of the proposal;
or an HR forgot to give you a feedback after a few steps of interviewing process;
or… well, I guess, you’ve got the point. // should I even go on?
 
How many or’s can you write?
How many or’s have you ever had?
How many stupid reject reasons have you heard about your profile and why you were rejected to that "ideal position"(to your mind)?
/
How many absurd excuses have you heard for not being given the position, which is perfect for you, in your opinion?
 
In each job seeking process, there is a place for shit, which happens to everyone.

Shit like this happens to everyone in any job seeking process even if you are a superstar.
 
I also had those terrible feelings, with most of them being present simultaneously.
Mostly Basically, I want to tell you about a lot of things that might be useful in any aspect of your life because they might change you, your understanding of communication with others and especially your self-esteem.
And here is something I found inside myself, which can help you in your future way of finding a perfect position.
 
Have you ever felt left behind by other, more flashy, more assertive people who get what they want while you’re just hanging there, helpless, cherishing what you have? I have reflected a lot of times on my internal disappointment from having no possibility to get the dream job even if I have had really high positions in previous companies. It wasn’t until the moment when I left my last job and found myself in the middle of a crucifying torture of numerous job interviews that I realized what one of my problems was. Modesty. ... 
Don’t be modest at work, in life, in communication with others, in your relationship. You should understand one simple fact - you are either modest or successful.
-----
I’m not saying don't say that you should be arrogant instead. Being non-modest is not about telling people how cool I am, or saying that I’m an amazing specialist and the best in my area when I’m actually not. It’s also better not to tell people about my vibrant life even if it is, or about things I bought last weekend. It’s not a good idea to be a me-person, either, that is, talking only about myself. No!
 
It's wrong way of understanding of "don't be modest". It should mean - tell about your achievements and real ambitions when you asked.
I’d like to make it clear that by ‘not being modest’ I mean that you should tell about your achievements and real ambitions or concerns when you are asked. For example posts you’ve written, great ideas you’ve shared, speeches you’ve made, projects you’ve finished, ideas you’re working on, "local world"(in your area) problems you’ve solved, fields you’re interested in and many more. The key point is not to Don't pay a lot of too much attention to yourself. Rather try to make an emphasis on the topic you’re talking about, make it more detailed, understandable and enjoyable for another person. So, in general, we should change the way we communicate with others and change our the approach to expressing ourselves.
 
But why? Why is there a need to change the approach to communication? So the answer is pretty straightforward. So far, mostly everything has been created by groups of people, not by individuals. All great projects or products has been created by groups of people and not by one person. People worked together, communicated, shared their ideas, helped each other to achieve their best or to solve their problems. Communication is the biggest part of everybody's lives. Everyday, everyone communicates with others in different ways, because it's the only one skill that can help you to express yourself, and can help you as well as to show everything from different, better sides.
 
Here is an example. What are today's biggest industries? Marketing and Advertising! Companies spend their billion budgets only with two simple thoughts in the mind - to present a product and sell it. They seek for the best slogans that will take capture minds of the whole world, for the best color combinations on their billboards that will hunt for draw attention, for the most сreative ideas that will express the whole product almost instantly. Companies are looking for the best ways to communicate and create strong communication bridges with their customers. So these industries are the way to communicate with the clients. Just one ad that spreads like a virus can change the whole history of the company's life. It can bring an extremely huge success and tremendous fail or even kill the company and bury it in the history. So, the biggest business makers are obligated to be really good in advertising and marketing. Let’s just try to remember the most recognizable company - Coca Cola. They use the same collors and fonts, songs and motives for a really long time. Now just only one second of their music from advertisment is enough for you to receive portion of good emotions related to our previous experience with that brand. They wasted on ad billions of dollars and now we don’t have anything new from them and easily can recognise the company without any issue. Mostly we saw that beautiful advertisment where Cola was shown in a really warm circumstances. Holidays in the family circle is really nice emotional connection almost for everybody in the world. And next time when you find Coca cola bottle, you can get that nice experience that brings similar to family feelings. 
 
But we can’t create the same experience as Coca Cola does for another person with whom we just want to work. So there are another side of good advertisment - words and how they are spreaded. It’s better to pay attention what I said and how I’m talking with others. Just by observation I tried to realise why one person is really well percieved and another person who said the same point but in another way, in another angle is percieved really differently and even wasn’t undertood in needed direction. Our communication is not only what we said, but also how we said that. We can use different words to express the same point. In different countries even English language used in different ways, but if we foreinger try to speak as natives speak he would be perceived as native. So just by using the same words which uses another person, you can be perceived from different angle. Also big part of that proccess take intonation, gestures and emotions on our face. Britans are really polite in their speech. They say a lot of polite words, praise without any tangible reason and just keen to be grateful.  Just a simple smile in the end of your sentence and tone decrease during argument can help you to rotate your discussion into another direction. Additional could or thanks in question will show that you are really need help, and will appreticate it. Simple question about “How are you?” or “How is it going?” before any further communication can help to start discussion from good point. So it’s nice to develop our day to day communication but it takes a more time than I thought. Even animals can’t live without communication. Yes Yeah, they don’t have special “phonetic language”. However, they do have different gestures such as wool raising when nervous, or lots of kinds of movements which help even to attract others or show their good and positive mood. For instance guinea pigs like to jump when they feels good. So me as a human, should communicate with others even more than animals do. This means that communication skill should be developed on high level and I should become a nice person to talk with.
 
Let’s get back to communication at work. Most of the valuable projects can't be done just only by one person or they can take a tremendous amount of time or even all your life and don't be finished. Pay a lot of attention on how you were heard and understood by others. How can you ask for help if you even can't construct a proper question. 
But you can say “Farmers or truck drivers almost don't talk to others…” Let’s be realists... I’m not a truck driver and my dream companies will consist of more that one person, and with each day I have to communicate with my colleagues. 
 
Why we can't take this simple idea of marketing and advertisment - express yourself? Why I can't sell myself like a product that will fit all future requirements of the client, which is a company in my case? But it sounds like manipulation of others by communication by "good advertisment"? But I don’t like to manipulate. Hmm, no, it shouldn’t be about that. Communication should help just only to demonstrate me from good side. To tell the correct things and even words to express your experience. You should grown inside yourself an abbility to sell your skills and experience, to tell about yourself. Even with the correct idea that expressed with wrong words you can destroy your whole speech, burn communication bridges and distract another person. You should improve the way you talk, express, discuss, argue, praise. Because even the best specialist, really the cool guy like Elon Musk but without skill to speak, who can't tell about his work will not get the good position, nobody will know about his abilities and how good he is.
But what can I say, what can I share about myself? What is the best my part? I understood, everything I did previously is already my a part of me what can I talk about. I was really scared to tell about myself at least something good, about my achievements, about my plans for the future. Everything I was saying sounded like bragging and brought me that frightening feeling "I'm not real, my achievements aren't real, my experience is not real, what will happen if they start asking me questions?". It's real impostor syndrome and it had been hunting me all my life and had been trying to ruin my carrer. That terrifying feeling was eating my mind on each interview, on each meetup, even when I taught others helping them to become better. The main question I wanted to ask myself was "How can I overcome it? How to kill that imaginary friend who eats my life?". Without it my career and life can become brighter and less painful. So how can to fix it? And the question came just in few days. Observation and investigation. It's like to be a scientist which trying to learn more about our wild and marvellous nature.
So the starting point for me was - to investigate my whole experience from the beginning, try to remind my knowledge and put the line under the points of my life where I was the most productive, did the coollest things in perspective of work, where performed the most incredible objectives. So trying to find some proper instrument to break impostor syndrom I found a really good technique. Investigation of your personal experience requires just one simple thing - asking simple questions and answering them:
- What have I done during last month?
- What was the most valuable thing in my todo?
- What I have achieved?
- What I haven't achieved?
- What I want to achieve next month?
Constan't investigation and observation process helped to perceive, how many things I worked on, how many new staff I learned, how many todo's I've planned and how many of them are already crossed out. So just the line under the most valuable and interesting of them and remember - you are not impostor, you are a specialist. Be proud of yourself even if there are a lot of things you haven't done and don't be nervous. Realise one simple thing if you are constantly working in any topic and tries to grow as a specialist as a person - you will have something to say about during your next interview.
Be sure in the things that you've done or worked with.
 
Don't be scared of interviews and try not to be nervous before or on them. Make a short experiment. Schedule two different interviews in two different companies where one company is the company you are interested in and another one is something where you don't want to work. In first case you will be nervous, will not know what to expect. You would be possibly scared of questions that would be possibly asked you during interviewing process, and your internal tension and nervousness will drain all your mental energy. On interview you will be possibly devastated and would not be able to answer even simple questions or tell about yourself and make an emphasis on correct points of your work experience(if you have one). Nervousness bring you some uncertainty onto your answers.
Second interview, would be the easiest one, you will not feel distraction, anxiety, tension, you would be sure in most of your answers and would tell about yourself without any problems.
I had that two kind of interviews a lot of times. On the interview into one of my "dream" companies I was very nervous and even asked a strange question: "Why did you reply and schedule an interview with me?". I was not sure if I'm good enough and my skills would fit a companie's perspective. From the beginning stress started to eat my mind and drain my physical energy. Interviwer got my feelings, found me too stressed and said a funny joke which helped me to relax a bit. I found in my speech a lof of mistakes in simplest questions, I talked like a "Flash" without giving interviewer a possibility to realise what I'm talking about and why I'm talking about this. I was declined, even after the first screening interview where we just discussed topics related to everything around and not to my experience.
Then a while ago I had an interview in the company I wasn't interested. The situation with job search started to be very stressfull and frightening. No money, reduced amount of english classes, had a thought to stop taking them, even no possibility to invite my spouse somewhere. The criticality of situation goes over my psychological borders. I didn't have any internal wish to work in that "default" outsorcing company but wanted to get at least any job offer to return confidence. I hadn't prepared cause of my internal emptiness but it was the easiest job interview I had in my life. I felt like nothing exceptional happening with me right now we had a relly nice discussion like with friends. Without any problems I anwered to all questions, and we finished interview with positive set. Unfortunatelly I didn't get the offer, they found someone more experienced as HR said but, I don't think so, they just found a "cheaper" guy to work on "default" shitty tasks who will not ask additional questions about the project, profit, marketing, etc.
This different interviews sounds like "interesting and very stressfull, extremely hard interview where you should waste all your today's energy" and "not interesting but super easy" helped me to understand really useful tip: "don't be nervous and trust yourself". You should trust yourself and don't be scared to talk to others, even if this "others" ask you questions. Start thinking and learn how to improvise. Nothing exceptional will happen in basic job interview if you will not have a plan of that interview, you will just check yourself in non standard situation where you can find how your brain is working. Don't think about stupid situations, don't imagine: "what can happen if..." it's not necessary.
During your job search procedure you can receive a lot of different declines with a lot of funny reasons, the first one is: "Sorry but we found a person who fit more requirement's than you". Mostly companies doesn't tell you a reall reason of decline and it can really differ from what they told you. I was declined a lot of times, and 90% of declines looked like the same template message, even after 2 monthes of the very last step of companies application. Sometimes HR managers can forget to give you a feedback, if so just ask them about it, don't be scared to ask, it' shouldn't cost you more than stand up from the chair.
At the moment of last my job search I already had 5 years of experience, but I found a really valuable job position in international company with really cool guys only after 15 declines during 3 weeks, I almost gave up. Don't pay attention to most of declines, try to analyse what really stands behind decline, you are really bad at something and don't have a proper experience or you just bad at "selling yourself".
Be confident in yourself, in your skills, in the rate you request, in the job you are looking for, be stable and ambitios take from life what you want to take and get the job you always have dreamed and don't forget to Reflect all the time you live your life!
