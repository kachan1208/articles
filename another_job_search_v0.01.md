Title: Another job search.

Have you ever feel anxiety, tension, nervousness, internal emptiness, uselessness and much more negative emotions 
that shows you your inability to find a proper place for your skills? 

If no, I have a bad news for you, are you a human beeing?!

But at least once per your arising or even already grown career path you have felt that terrible feelings. 

Just be honest with yourself, you had a lot of declines because company found someone who are more experienced than you;
or your skills don't match with the companie's view about ideal candidate and you were declined even without any interview;
or you feel that you can't match a least half of the requierments of the proposal;
or HR forgot to give you a feedback after the few steps of interviewing process;
or...;

How many "or" you can write? 
How many "or" have you ever had? 
How many stupid reasons you heard about yourself and why you were declined to that "ideal position"(to your mind)? 

In each job seeking process there are a place for that shit, that can happen with everyone.

I also had that terrible feelings, even most of them were present simultaneously. 
Mostly I want to tell you about a lot of things that would be useful in any aspect of your life because they would change you, your understanding of communication with others and especially your self-esteem.
And here is what I found inside myself, what can help you in your future way of finding an ideal position. 

Don't be modest at work, in life, in communication with others, in your relationship. You should understan one simple fact - are you either modest or successful. I don't say that you should tell how cool you are, don't say that you are an amazing specialist and the best in his area, don't tell people about your wealth or thing that you bought last weekend, don't tell to each other about yourself a lot! No! It's wrong way of understanding of "don't be modest". It should mean - tell about your achievements and real ambitions when you asked. For example posts you written, speaches you did, projects you finished, ideas you are working on, "local world"(in your area) problems you solved, fields you interested in and much more. Don't pay a lot of attention on yourself, try to make an emphasis on the topic you are talking, make it more detailed, understandable and enjoyable for another person. So, mostly we should change our approach in communication with others.  

But why? Why we should change our approach in communication? Nowadays mostly everything was created by group of people, not by individual. All great projects or products were created by group of people and not by one person, they communicated, shared their ideas, helped each other to achieve their best or to solve their problems. Communication is the biggest part of everybodies lives. Everyday, everyone communicate with each other in different ways. Because it's the only one skill that can help you to express yourslef, and show you from another side which. But let's try to figure it out on example. What is one of the biggest today's industries? Marketing! Companies spends their billions budgets only with one thought in the mind - to sell you a product. They seek for the best slogans that will take your minds, for the best collor combinations on their billboards that will hunt for your attention, for the most —Åreative ideas that will express the whole product almost instantly. Companies are looking for the way to communicate with you. Advertisment is way to communicate with the clients. Just one ad, that spreads like a virus can change the whole history of the companie's life. It can bring an extremely huge success and tremendous fail or even kill the company and bury it in the history. So, the biggest business makers, are really good in advertisment. 

Why we can't take this simple idea of marketing - express yourself? Why we can't sell ourselves like a product that will fit all future requirements of the client, which is a company in our case? But it sounds like we want to manipulate others by communication, by "good advertisment"? No, it's not about that. Communication will help you just to tell about yourself. To tell the correct things and even words to express your experience. You should grown inside yourself an abbility to sell your skills and experience, to tell about yourself. Even with the correct idea that expressed with wrong words you can destroy your whole speech, burn communication bridges and distract another person. You should improve the way you talk, express, discuss, argue, praise. Because even the best specialist, really the cool guy like Elon Musk but without skill to speak, who can't tell about his work will not get the good position, nobody will know about his abilities and how good he is. 

Also, just develop your day to day communication skill and become a nice person to talk with. You can become a farmer or a truck driver and almost don't talk to others... But we are realists... All your further dream companies will consist of more that one person, and with you have to communicate with your colleagues, It's might be better to say "YOU MUST COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS". Most of the valuable project's can't be done just only by one person or they can take a tremendous amount of time or even all your life and don't be finished. And pay a lot of attention on how you were heard and understood by others. How can you ask for help if you even can't construct a proper question. 

Now we understand that we should express yourself, but we don't understand how to show our best sides. So how can we do that? We need to investigate our whole experience, our knowledge and put the line under the points of our life where we were the most productive, did the coollest things in perspective of work. Choose one day during next three monthes and just ask yourself several questions: 

 - What have I done?
 - What was the most valuable thing to do?
 - What I have achieved?
 - What I haven't achieved?
 - What I want to achieve during next three monthes?

Constan't investigation process will show you, how many things you've done, how many things you've learned, how many things you've planned to do and how many of them you've finished. Put the line under the most valuable and interesting of them and remember - you are not impostor, you are a specialist. Be proud of yourself even if there are a lot of things you haven't done and don't be nervous.
Realise one simple thing if you are constantly working in any topic and tries to grow as a specialist as a person - you will have something to say about during your next interview.

Be sure in the things that you've done or worked with. ...

Don't be scared of interviews and try not to be nervous before or on them. Make a short experiment. Schedule two different interviews in two different companies where one company is the company you are interested in and another one is something where you don't want to work. In first case you will be nervous, will not know what to expect. You would be possibly scared of questions that would be possibly asked you during interviewing process, and your internal tension and nervousness will drain all your mental energy. On interview you will be possibly devastated and would not be able to answer even simple questions or tell about yourself and make an emphasis on correct points of your work experience(if you have one). Nervousness bring you some uncertainty onto your answers. 
Second interview, would be the easiest one, you will not feel distraction, anxiety, tension, you would be sure in most of your answers and would tell about yourself without any problems.

I had that two kind of interviews a lot of times. On the interview with one of my "dream" companies I was very nervous and even asked a question: "Why did you reply and schedule an interview with me?". I was not sure that my skills would fit a companie's perspective. From the beginning stress started to eat my mind and drain my physical energy. I started to make a lof of mistakes in simplest questions, talked like a "flash" without giving interviewer a possibility to realise what I'm talking about and why I'm talking about this. I was declined, even after the first screening interview where we just discussed topics related to everything around and not to my experience.
